# Watch : A flutter movie reccomendation app

A flutter based movie reccomendation app that reccomends movies/ web series using the TMBD api.

## About this project
This is an open source movies / Webseries reccomendation app using the TMDB API. 
As you all know the implementation of the TMDB api is pretty easy , so the app functionality is pretty easy , we are mainly focusing on the app UI, Which must be super premuim looking :)

## Updates about the present condition of the app
Currently the splash screen , login screen , the home screen , the explore screen, the Full details page UI is done (The TMDB api has not been connected yet , We'll implement that after all the UI is complete.). Currently the setings page UI is under progress and after that the api implementation will be done, starting with the simple search functionality.


### Future plans about the project
As this is an open source project till now , I'm focusing on just UI completion , and then the api would be used to populate realtime data
This is also a cross platform app , as it's ,made using flutter , so we need to implement proper resposnsiveness as well (considering a web version as well)
